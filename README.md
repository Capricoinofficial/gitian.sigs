This repository contains gitian signatures for Capricoin+ Core.
It should be updated on each release.

## How to Make and Submit Gitian Sigs

See the release process in the Capricoin+ Core repository on how to build the
release archives to create gitian sigs. This can be found in
`doc/release-process.md`. Be sure to use the release process of **the tag that
you're building**, so for example https://github.com/Capricoinofficial/capricoinplus-core/blob/master/doc/release-process.md for
`v0.18.1`.

[Instructions for setting up a gitian build environment](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/docs/blob/master/gitian-building.md)
can also be found there.
